    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work, you will need to have a few things set-up beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A version 4 of neo4j needs to be installed, as the database is not compatible with version 5.\n",
    "    I suggest taking the latest version 4 which is 4.4.10 at the time of writing.\n",
    "    Using the requirements.txt file to install packages should mean you have a usable version installed.\n",
    "    Make sure the kernel you are using when running the notebook is one where you have this installed.\n",
    "2. The database already needs to be running locally on your machine.\n",
    "    So you have to have gone through the steps to set it up via Neo4j Desktop and started it up.\n",
    "3. The connection credentials need to be included.\n",
    "    These are saved in a hidden file (ignored by git), so you can update yours once and be good to go.\n",
    "    If this file is not found, it makes one from some defaults which probably won't work (due to the database password).\n",
    "    However, you can then edit the personal_settings.csv file (NOT the default_settings.csv file) to match your credentials.\n",
    "    Note that the setup here is designed to make it work simultaneously for all of us.\n",
    "    It is NOT a strong security method, so make sure your db password is NOT being used by you elsewhere for anything important."
